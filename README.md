# Wind-Waker-Chaos-Edition-EUR-
The Gecko Code for the new Chaos Edition

You will need the European version of the game! (Just because this one has the most cheat codes available and is the best documented by me since I don't have the NTSC-U disc)
Simply right click the game on Dolphin's game list and click "Edit Config"
Add the cheat code with the $-comment beneath [GECKO] (add [GECKO] if it's not there).
Check the code on the list and have fun.
The new version consists of a cheat code because there's not enough static padding inside the .dol and it's easier to edit.
This includes the code by Dybbles to skip the tedious intro.
